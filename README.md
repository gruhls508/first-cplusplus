I never had an opportunity to learn c++, so I've been following the tutorial at http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/


- I'm providing a few screens of the results of my code--I'm taking the examples from the walkthrough and tweaking them.
- You might recognize the IDE--I use Xcode as its a really great environment for writing/running c++, and well..it's what I know best.
